To compile, simply, type ''make'' at the terminal (without the quotes).

â€“ How to run: a makefile was created for the project, therefore in order to compile the program, all that is needed is to type 'make' in the
  corresponding directory and it will automatically build the components. From there, to run the program, one must simply type the necessary
  arguments indicating the cipher, encryption/decryption, the key to be used, and the input/output files to be used/created.
  
  e.g. ./cipher <CIPHER NAME> <KEY> <ENC/DEC> <INPUTFILE> <OUTPUT FILE>

  All required ciphers implemented, possible cipher names:
  - plf (Playfair)
  - rts (Row Transposition)
  - rfc (Railfence)
  - vig (Vigenere)
  - ces (Caesar)
